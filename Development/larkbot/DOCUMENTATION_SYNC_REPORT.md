## Current Implementation Summary

### Webhook Filtering Logic
The system now ONLY captures tickets with these specific "Onsite Request Type" values:
- "üë• Site Inspection - New Merchant"
- "üë• Site Inspection - Existing Merchant"

All other L2 onsite tickets (hardware troubleshooting, etc.) are ignored.

### Interactive Card Format
- Blue header for most events (opened, assigned)
- Turquoise for replies
- Yellow for notes
- Green for closed tickets
- Orange for reopened tickets

### Message Limits
- Card format: 1000 characters (increased from 300)
- Text format: 1500 characters (increased from 700)

### Environment Variables
- Multiple chat group support:
  - LARK_CHAT_GROUP_ID_MYPHFE
  - LARK_CHAT_GROUP_ID_COMPLEX_SETUP
  - LARK_CHAT_GROUP_ID (fallback)

## Recommendation
Update the PRD.md and TICKET_AUTOMATION_SETUP.md files to accurately reflect the current implementation, particularly the site inspection filtering and interactive card format features.
